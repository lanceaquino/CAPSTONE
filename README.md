# CAPSTONE

This marks the start of the Capstone Project Repository for the Web Application: PITAKA 

Version: alpha 1.0 

## Reminders 

This is a sample of the Pitaka website showcasing its main functions and appearance. For now, 
it's temporarily held in Github servers for further product testing and improvements. 

## Page main contents 

1. **Home Page**: The main page shows the title and the tagline of the website. This introduces the primary purpose and features of the website. This website can potentially publish reviews, ads, and other similar content for adding legitimacy and credibility. Another feature of this page is the signup page for newsletters and updates.

2. **Articles Page**: The article's page (Articles on Digital Finance) is a compilation of financial articles about help being more informed in personal financing and keeping up with the trends in financial tech. Depending on the amount of content developed, the featured articles will be shown first, and other articles can be accessed later on with a "Show all articles" link.
Additionally, the first article is already published on the website and ready to be viewed. The article is titled "The Importance of financial literacy" and can be viewed here. Ideally, new content should be uploaded regularly as it is also a critical factor in acquiring more visitors to the website.

3. **Digital Wallet Comparison Page**: For the digital wallet comparison, this serves as the interactive space for users to provide reviews and compare digital wallets' features, usage, and information. The design is still in progress, and it is supposed to be the most dynamic aspect of the website. Additionally, users can submit their digital wallet reviews, which people can look into to have a more user-centric opinion on the products.

4. **Contact Us Page**: The contact page (About Us) serves as a means for the developer to contact its users regarding feedback, opinions, and other thoughts that could add another level of interactivity between the user and the developer.
