              Digital Wallets: What are they and Why should you get one?

              Have you ever heard of GCash? You’ve seen it in your local mango ice cream store. How about PayMaya? Your mobile games most likely showed it as an option for in-game transactions. GCash and Paymaya are two examples of digital wallets used today. These wallets come in the form of mobile applications and would serve as your mobile bank account. 
            </p>

            <p id = 'article-text'>
              These digital wallets are helpful. You can use them to pay for shops, restaurants, and even street vendors. You can also use them to send money to your friends and family. Some digital wallets offer the options for booking movie tickets and spas, while others serve as virtual debit cards that can be used to withdraw cash from the ATM. 
            </p>

            <p id = 'article-text'>
              The main goal of these digital wallets is to make transactions more tractable, transparent, and safer for business owners and customers alike. 
            </p>

            <p id = 'article-text'>
              There are over three types of digital wallets: closed, semi-closed, and open wallets. 

            </p>

            <p id = 'article-text'>
              Closed wallets are usually part of e-commerce companies such as Lazada (similar to Amazon). Money stored in these wallets is only exclusive for purchase within the Lazada store. The selling point of these wallets is the rewards and cashback that it offers for every transaction. 

            </p>

            <p id = 'article-text'>
              Semi-closed wallets can be used to purchase items from partner stores that are either online or physical stores. Unlike closed wallets, these stores need not be under the same company. The stores would only need a partnership with GCash to be part of the digital wallet’s services. Customers can also use it to send money to fellow GCash users. 

            </p>

            <p id = 'article-text'>
              Open wallets are named that way because of their close resemblance to debit cards. These open wallets would provide customers with their own virtual card that can be used as a debit card for online purchases. It would have its own number, date, and CVV, which are information that is usually asked for online transactions. Paymaya is one example, and they provide customers with a VISA card. 

            </p>

            <p id = 'article-text'>
              So why get a digital wallet? The main reason is convenience. These digital wallets eliminate the troubles cash creates and save more time and money for people. Instead of driving to the local vendors to pay bills, you can now settle them online with your digital wallet. More and more users are now adapting to the digital wallet life, and it is only a matter of time before your friends would require you to have one for them to settle their debts from your recent night out. 

            </p>

            <p id = 'article-text'>
              Digital wallets also help you manage your finances properly. These applications are designed to track your expenses, bills, and recurring payments. I’m sure you may have forgotten at least once to cancel your Netflix subscription. 

            </p>

            <p id = 'article-text'>
              There are also opportunities to grow your money. Some digital wallets have options for stock and crypto trading. Coins.ph is one great example where the platform is suitable for both new and long-time traders. 

            </p>
